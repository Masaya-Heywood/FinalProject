These scripts are best used for enemy pathfinding only.
A* Pathfinding is good for reaching a target (Our Player) in the shortest amount of time possible while still being aware of all obsticles in the way. 

The Grid script creates a grid for the enemies to walk on

The node script is the "brains" behind grid, each node holds the variables that enemies use to determine
if they are optimal to walk in or not. Don't assign this script to anything.

The pathfinding script is self explanitory, it finds paths for enemies. Place it on the same object that has the grid script for organization.

The heap script is for optimization purposes. Don't touch.

The Unit script must be attached to enemies for them to use the navigation system.

--------

To choose where the enemies go, select an object to be a target. (Currently the enemies are moving on an offset, this needs to be fixed)
Edit the variables in the Grid script, "Grid World Size" determines the space enemies will find paths in and "Grid radius" determines the precision. Higher Grid Radius the more performance heavy the game will be.
To make objects that you don't want enemies to walk through, set the layer of the obsticles to "Unwalkable"

Be sure the enemy unit has a rigidbody2D on it and its gravity is set to zero. The units speed is named speed on the Unit script. Select the unit's target in the editor or through code by fetching the component. 

That's it! A* Should be working.
