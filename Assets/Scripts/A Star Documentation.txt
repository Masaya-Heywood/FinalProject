These scripts are best used for enemy path finding only.
A* Pathfinding is good for reaching a target (Our Player) in the shortest amount of time possible. 

The Grid script creates a grid for the enemies to walk on

The node script is the "brains" behind grid, each node holds the variables that enemies use to determine
if they are optimal to walk in or not. Don't assign to anything

The pathfinding script is self explanitory, it finds paths for enemies. Don't assign to anything.

The heap script is for optimization purposes. Don't touch.

The Unit script must be attached to enemies for them to use the navigation system.
